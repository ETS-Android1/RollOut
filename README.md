# RollOut

RollOut is a Android-based mobile application designed with the intention of making ride sharing more accessible to people to further prevent drunk driving. 
It allows users to easily compare prices and time estimates from Uber, Lyft and local cab companies to make the decision that best fits their needs. 
In addition, it allows users to create a network to allow for carpooling and sober driver designation. 
Future developments also include local event incorporation to allow users to see different events happening near them, who is attending and how much a ride would cost to that event.
